{"user_input": "Hello, how are you?", "ai_response": "I'm happy to help you with your question. However, I don't see any context or previous conversation history. Since we're starting from scratch, I'll play along and respond based on the information provided.\n\nGiven that there's no specific context or role mentioned in the recent conversation, I'll assume it's a new interaction. If you'd like to provide more context or specify what kind of response is expected (e.g., friendly greeting, inquiry about the user), I can adjust my response accordingly.\n\nHere's my initial response:\n\nHello! How are you today?"}
