# Historical Poker Simulation System

A poker simulation system that generates rich historical narratives and corresponding audio records, designed for archival and training purposes.

## Core Components

### Historical Poker Engine
- Simulates poker games with historically-inspired personas
- Tracks player actions, fate points, and game progression
- Integrates historical context and architectural settings
- Generates oracle commentary with historical parallels

### Audio Interface System
- Creates dynamic soundscapes for game events
- Maps cards, actions, and events to specific frequencies
- Maintains multiple audio streams:
  - Card sounds based on suit/value
  - Chip sounds scaled by bet amounts
  - Player action indicators
  - Round markers
  - Historical commentary

### Pattern Recognition
- Records and analyzes audio patterns
- Stores metadata about game events
- Enables similarity matching between patterns
- Creates an evolving database of historical game moments

## Technical Features

### Audio Generation
- Sample rate: 44.1kHz
- Multiple frequency mappings for game events
- Automated mixing of concurrent streams
- Fade-in/fade-out handling
- Audio pattern storage and retrieval

### Historical Context
- Dynamic oracle commentary
- Architectural significance tracking
- Historical parallels for game events
- Fate point system for player agency

### File Management
- WAV file output
- Pattern database persistence
- Serialized game state storage
- Historical record archiving

## Usage

```python
from historical_poker import create_historical_game
from audio_interface import AudioInterface

# Initialize system
audio = AudioInterface()
table = create_historical_game(players_data)

# Run simulation
table.deal_cards()
# ... game progression ...

# Generate audio record
audio.save_game_audio("game_record.wav")
```

## Implementation Details

### Audio Pattern Storage
- Frequency analysis
- Amplitude envelope tracking
- Pattern similarity matching
- Metadata association

### Historical Integration
- Era-specific sound profiles
- Cultural context markers
- Architectural acoustics simulation
- Historical event correlation

## Purpose

This system serves as both a simulation platform and a self-documenting historical archive. Each game generates:
- Audio records of gameplay
- Historical narratives
- Pattern recognition data
- Training datasets for future simulations

The audio generation system acts as an artificial archivist, creating auditory records that preserve both the mechanical and historical aspects of each simulation.
